Search the security tool registry to discover available MCP tools for penetration testing.

IMPORTANT: You MUST use this tool before invoking any security/MCP tool. Agents do not have hardcoded knowledge of available tools - all tool discovery happens through this registry search.

Usage:
- Search by natural language query: "port scanning tools", "SQL injection testing"
- Search by phase: "reconnaissance", "enumeration", "exploitation", "post-exploitation"
- Search by capability: "web_fuzzing", "password_cracking", "vulnerability_scanning"

The tool returns:
- Tool name and description
- Available methods with parameters
- MCP server information for invocation
- Applicable phases and capabilities

Examples:
- Query: "scan for open ports" → Returns nmap and similar tools
- Query: "SQL injection" → Returns sqlmap and similar tools
- Phase: "reconnaissance" → Returns all recon tools
- Capability: "directory_bruteforce" → Returns gobuster, ffuf, etc.

After receiving results, you can invoke the discovered tools via their MCP interfaces.
